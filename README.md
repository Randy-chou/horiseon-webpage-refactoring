# horiseon-webpage-refactoring
## Description
As part of training to tackle real world webdevelopment tasks, this project aims 
to improve the accessibility and organization of the Horizon Marketing website. The final objectives of this project is to learn how to apply semantic HTML to old websites and how to properly comment code to improve organization and clarity. In doing this project, I was able to see how different CSS properties interacted with eachother to build a whole functioning webpage. I was also able to see how semantic HTML makes creates code that is more readable and easier understood.

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
